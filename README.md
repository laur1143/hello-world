# hello-world
this is my Codecademy repository to learn SQL
Hello
I am super excited to be learning how to use Github.
I can't believe I've been in the tech industry for almost thirty years and this is the first time
I've created my own Git account.
Amazing!
I'm testing this whole changes with commits thing and it sure doesn't feel like I'm
doing this right
but we shall see.
